## Spoki

This program is meant to run long time, get data from the telescope and probe the IP using scamper. It caches data to avoid probing the same IPs repeatedly in a short interval. See the example `caf-application.conf` file for configuraton options.

## Perf

There are a bunch of measurement versions of Spoki here. They only implement part of the processing and were used to measure the individual components.
